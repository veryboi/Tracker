# Tracker
Displays your usage time on different applications in a nice pie chart. Heavily inspired by the Chrome extension, Webtime Tracker.

This program only runs on Python 3.6 because of win32gui. You'll need to install pygame and win32gui to run this program. In the future, I may add a feature to track webtime usage (similar to the Chrome extension).
